{ name: "Rafel Nadal", rank: 2 },
{ name: "Nalbandian", rank: 12 },
{ name: "Andy Murray", rank: 14 },
{ name: "Andy Roddick", rank: 4 },
{ name: "Pete Sampras", rank: 3 },
{ name: "Rod Laver", rank: 190 },
{ name: "Andre Agassi", rank: 11 },
{ name: "Novak Djokovic", rank: 5 },
{ name: "Arthur Ashe", rank: 8 },
];
```
